# ðŸš€ Starting Charging Station API

### `prerequisites`
Install required packages

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### `start`

Start your Strapi application

```
npm run start
# or
yarn start

```

### `additional`

You can also run eslint (with prettier plugin)

```
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint

### `note`
If you're not running on Strapi's default port (1337), change the port on Charging Station Web config file to match yours.

```
charging-station-web
â””â”€â”€â”€src    
    â””â”€â”€â”€config
         â””â”€â”€â”€index.ts
```
I've provided the the .env and data.db in the attachhment. This db file contains some existing locations as well as the necessary data for Country and Charger Type as it runs locally
